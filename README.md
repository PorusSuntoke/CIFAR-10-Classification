# CIFAR-10-Classification
CIFAR - 10 is a dataset that consists of several images divided into the following 10 classes :
Airplanes, Cars, Birds, Cats, Deer, Dogs, Frogs, Horses, Ships, Trucks. 
The dataset stands for Canadian Institue For Advanced Research.
The dataset consists of 60,000 32 * 32 color images and 6,000 images of each class. 
The reason for attaching two codes is that I have done this project using 2 frameworks: TensorFlow and Pytorch.
I have evaluated the model by observing the model's performance on images downloaded from the internet.
The model was able to correctly classify most of the images.
